# Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the Crypto Price Tracker, several challenges were encountered. This document outlines these challenges and the solutions implemented.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge
The CoinGecko API has rate limits for free tier usage, which could potentially cause issues during development or heavy usage.

### Solution
To address API rate limiting:
- Implemented caching to reduce the number of API calls
- Added error handling to gracefully manage rate limit errors
- Set a reasonable refresh interval (60 seconds) to avoid hitting rate limits
- Provided a manual refresh button instead of continuous polling

## State Management Complexity

### Challenge
Managing application state, including loading states, error handling, and search functionality, presented complexity challenges.

### Solution
- Used Zustand to create a simple, centralized state management solution
- Separated concerns by creating dedicated functions for data fetching and search
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety

## Responsive Design

### Challenge
Ensuring the application looks good and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices was challenging.

### Solution
- Used Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Implemented a mobile-first approach
- Created flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Tested on various viewport sizes to ensure consistent user experience

## Loading State Management

### Challenge
Managing loading states during initial load and subsequent refreshes without disrupting the user experience.

### Solution
- Implemented a dedicated loading indicator component
- Used conditional rendering to show loading states only when appropriate
- Kept existing data visible during refresh operations
- Added visual feedback for the refresh button when loading

## Search Functionality

### Challenge
Implementing effective search functionality that filters cryptocurrencies in real-time without performance issues.

### Solution
- Used Zustand state management for the search term
- Implemented client-side filtering for instant results
- Optimized the filter function to search both by name and symbol
- Ensured the UI updates reactively as the user types
